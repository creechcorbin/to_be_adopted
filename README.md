# Summary:

The premise of this application is to provide a resource for pet adoptions and connect shelters, rescues and fosters with potential adopters to find forever homes for pets. We used a full Django backend with some Bootstrap for styling.

Functionalities include:

- Authentication (Login, Logout, Signup)
- Creating and Editing Pet Profiles
- Sorting out database by status (more sorting functionality to be included in the future)
- Notifications for pets from shelters/rescues being favorited.

Future developments include:
- Instant messaging
- Email functionality
- Prescreening functionality
